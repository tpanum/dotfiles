(autoload 'general-define-key "general" "\
The primary key definition function provided by general.el.

Define MAPS, optionally using DEFINER, in the keymap(s) corresponding to STATES
and KEYMAPS.

MAPS consists of paired keys (vectors or strings; also see
`general-implicit-kbd') and definitions (those mentioned in `define-key''s
docstring and general.el's \"extended\" definitions). All pairs (when not
ignored) will be recorded and can be later displayed with
`general-describe-keybindings'.

If DEFINER is specified, a custom key definer will be used to bind MAPS. See
general.el's documentation/README for more information.

Unlike with normal key definitions functions, the keymaps in KEYMAPS should be
quoted (this allows using the keymap name for other purposes, e.g. deferring
keybindings if the keymap symbol is not bound, optionally inferring the
corresponding major mode for a symbol by removing \"-map\" for :which-key,
easily storing the keymap name for use with `general-describe-keybindings',
etc.). Note that general.el provides other key definer macros that do not
require quoting keymaps.

STATES corresponds to the evil state(s) to bind the keys in. Non-evil users
should not set STATES. When STATES is non-nil, `evil-define-key*' will be
used (the evil auxiliary keymaps corresponding STATES and KEYMAPS will be used);
otherwise `define-key' will be used (unless DEFINER is specified). KEYMAPS
defaults to 'global. There is also 'local, which create buffer-local
keybindings for both evil and non-evil keybindings. There are other special,
user-alterable \"shorthand\" symbols for keymaps and states (see
`general-keymap-aliases' and `general-state-aliases').

Note that STATES and KEYMAPS can either be lists or single symbols. If any
keymap does not exist, those keybindings will be deferred until the keymap does
exist, so using `eval-after-load' is not necessary with this function.

PREFIX corresponds to a key to prefix keys in MAPS with and defaults to none. To
bind/unbind a key specified with PREFIX, \"\" can be specified as a key in
MAPS (e.g. ...:prefix \"SPC\" \"\" nil... will unbind space).

The keywords in this paragraph are only useful for evil users. If
NON-NORMAL-PREFIX is specified, this prefix will be used instead of PREFIX for
states in `general-non-normal-states' (e.g. the emacs and insert states). This
argument will only have an effect if one of these states is in STATES or if
corresponding global keymap (e.g. `evil-insert-state-map') is in KEYMAPS.
Alternatively, GLOBAL-PREFIX can be used with PREFIX and/or NON-NORMAL-PREFIX to
bind keys in all states under the specified prefix. Like with NON-NORMAL-PREFIX,
GLOBAL-PREFIX will prevent PREFIX from applying to `general-non-normal-states'.
INFIX can be used to append a string to all of the specified prefixes. This is
potentially useful when you are using GLOBAL-PREFIX and/or NON-NORMAL-PREFIX so
that you can sandwich keys in between all the prefixes and the specified keys in
MAPS. This may be particularly useful if you are using default prefixes in a
wrapper function/macro so that you can add to them without needing to re-specify
all of them. If none of the other prefix keyword arguments are specified, INFIX
will have no effect.

If PREFIX-COMMAND or PREFIX-MAP is specified, a prefix command and/or keymap
will be created. PREFIX-NAME can be additionally specified to set the keymap
menu name/prompt. If PREFIX-COMMAND is specified, `define-prefix-command' will
be used. Otherwise, only a prefix keymap will be created. Previously created
prefix commands/keymaps will never be redefined/cleared. All prefixes (including
the INFIX key, if specified) will then be bound to PREFIX-COMMAND or PREFIX-MAP.

PREDICATE corresponds to a predicate to check to determine whether a definition
should be active (e.g. \":predicate '(eobp)\"). Definitions created with a
predicate will only be active when the predicate is true. When the predicate is
false, key lookup will continue to search for a match in lower-precedence
keymaps.

In addition to the normal definitions supported by `define-key', general.el also
provides \"extended\" definitions, which are plists containing the normal
definition as well as other keywords. For example, PREDICATE can be specified
globally or locally in an extended definition. New global (~general-define-key~)
and local (extended definition) keywords can be added by the user. See
`general-extended-def-keywords' and general.el's documentation/README for more
information.

PACKAGE is the global version of the extended definition keyword that specifies
the package a keymap is defined in (used for \"autoloading\" keymaps)

PROPERTIES, REPEAT, and JUMP are the global versions of the extended definition
keywords used for adding evil command properties to commands.

MAJOR-MODES, WK-MATCH-KEYS, WK-MATCH-BINDINGS, and WK-FULL-KEYS are the
corresponding global versions of which-key extended definition keywords. They
will only have an effect for extended definitions that specify :which-key or
:wk. See the section on extended definitions in the general.el
documentation/README for more information.

LISPY-PLIST and WORF-PLIST are the global versions of extended definition
keywords that are used for each corresponding custom DEFINER.

\(fn)" t nil)

(autoload 'general-simulate-keys "general" "\
Create a function to simulate KEYS in STATE and KEYMAP.
STATE should only be specified by evil users and can be a quoted evil state or
t (in which case emacs state will be used). When neither STATE or KEYMAP are
specified, the keys will be simulated in the current context. Normally the
generated function will look up KEYS in the correct context to try to match a
command or keymap. To prevent this lookup, NO-LOOKUP can be specified as
non-nil. See the docstring for `general--simulate-keys' for some insight as to
why you might want to use this.

KEYS should be a string given in `kbd' notation. It can also be a list of a
single command followed by a string of the keys to simulate after calling that
command. If DOCSTRING is given, it will replace the automatically generated
docstring. If NAME is given, it will replace the automatically generated
function name. NAME should not be quoted.

The advantages of this over a keyboard macro are as follows:
- The user can control the context in which the keys are simulated
- The user can simulate both a command and keys
- The user can simulate a partial key sequence (e.g. for a keymap)

\(fn KEYS &optional STATE KEYMAP NO-LOOKUP DOCSTRING NAME)" nil t)

(autoload 'general-key-dispatch "general" "\
Create a function that will run FALLBACK-COMMAND or a command from MAPS.
MAPS consists of <key> <command> pairs. If a key in MAPS is matched, the
corresponding command will be run. Otherwise FALLBACK-COMMAND will be run with
the unmatched keys. So, for example, if \"ab\" was pressed, and \"ab\" is not
one of the key sequences from MAPS, the FALLBACK-COMMAND will be run followed by
the simulated keypresses of \"ab\". Prefix arguments will still work regardless
of which command is run. This is useful for binding under non-prefix keys. For
example, this can be used to redefine a sequence like \"cw\" or \"cow\" in evil
but still have \"c\" work as `evil-change'. If TIMEOUT is specified,
FALLBACK-COMMAND will also be run in the case that the user does not press the
next key within the TIMEOUT (e.g. 0.5).

NAME and DOCSTRING are optional keyword arguments. They can be used to replace
the automatically generated name and docstring for the created function and are
potentially useful if you want to create multiple, different commands using the
same FALLBACK-COMMAND (e.g. `self-insert-command').

When INHERIT-KEYMAP is specified, all the keybindings from that keymap will be
inherited in MAPS.

WHICH-KEY can also be specified, in which case the description WHICH-KEY will
replace the command name in the which-key popup. Note that this requires a
version of which-key from after 2016-11-21.

(autoload 'general-translate-key "general" "\
Translate keys in the keymap(s) corresponding to STATES and KEYMAPS.
STATES should be the name of an evil state, a list of states, or nil. KEYMAPS
should be a symbol corresponding to the keymap to make the translations in or a
list of keymap names. Keymap and state aliases are supported (as well as 'local
and 'global for KEYMAPS). MAPS corresponds to a list of translations (key
replacement pairs). For example, specifying \"a\" \"b\" will bind \"a\" to
\"b\"'s definition in the keymap. When `general-implicit-kbd' is non-nil, `kbd'
will be used on the keys and their replacements. If DESTRUCTIVE is non-nil, the
keymap will be destructively altered without a backup being created. If
DESTRUCTIVE is nil, a backup of the keymap will be stored on the initial
invocation, and future invocations will always look up keys in the backup
keymap. On the other hand, if DESTRUCTIVE is non-nil, calling this function
multiple times with \"a\" \"b\" \"b\" \"a\", for example, would continue to swap
and unswap the definitions of these keys. This means that when DESTRUCTIVE is
non-nil, all related swaps/cycles should be done in the same invocation.
